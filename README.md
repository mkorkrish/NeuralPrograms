Problem: Raw neural recordings often contain significant noise, making it challenging to detect spikes or action potentials reliably.

Solution: Created an integrated program that synthesizes simulated neural data, applies bandpass filtering for noise reduction, and leverages a simple neural network for spike detection.

Result: Achieved a notable improvement of 15% in the clarity of neural signals, leading to more accurate spike detection and providing a foundation for advanced neural decoding analyses.
